# Link Preview Fixes Complete

## Issue Identified
The SocialFusion app's link previews were showing as plain text links instead of rich preview cards like in Ivory. The link previews weren't displaying properly due to a configuration issue in the PostCardView.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the screenshots comparison and codebase, I found the core issue:

**PostCardView was conditionally disabling link previews**: In `PostCardView.swift`, link previews were being disabled (`showLinkPreview: false`) when posts contained media attachments. This meant that posts with images would never show rich link preview cards.

```swift
// OLD CODE - PROBLEMATIC
if displayPost.attachments.isEmpty {
    displayPost.contentView(lineLimit: nil, showLinkPreview: true, font: .body)
} else {
    displayPost.contentView(lineLimit: nil, showLinkPreview: false, font: .body)  // ❌ DISABLED
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Always Enable Link Previews
**File**: `SocialFusion/Views/Components/PostCardView.swift`

Removed the conditional logic and enabled link previews for all posts, regardless of whether they have media attachments:

```swift
// NEW CODE - FIXED
displayPost.contentView(lineLimit: nil, showLinkPreview: true, font: .body)
```

**Why this makes sense**: 
- Ivory shows both media AND link previews in the same post
- There's no technical reason to disable link previews when media is present
- Users expect to see rich link cards for URLs in posts

### 2. Verified StabilizedLinkPreview Implementation
The existing `StabilizedLinkPreview` component already had the correct implementation:
- ✅ Horizontal layout (image left, text right) matching Ivory's design
- ✅ Proper metadata extraction using `LPLinkMetadata`
- ✅ Rich card appearance with images, titles, descriptions
- ✅ Fallback handling for failed metadata loads
- ✅ Caching system for performance

## Expected Result

With this fix, the SocialFusion app should now:

1. **Display Rich Link Cards**: URLs in posts will show as proper preview cards with:
   - Website images/favicons
   - Page titles
   - Descriptions
   - Domain names

2. **Match Ivory's Layout**: Link previews will appear with the same clean, professional layout:
   - 72x72px images on the left
   - Text content aligned to the right
   - Consistent spacing and typography

3. **Work for All Posts**: Link previews will appear regardless of whether posts have media attachments

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful**: All changes compile without errors

## Testing Notes
- Link previews should now appear for posts containing URLs
- The app will fetch metadata from websites to create rich preview cards
- Both posts with and without media attachments will show link previews
- The preview layout should match the clean Ivory style shown in your screenshots

The link preview functionality should now work exactly like Ivory, displaying rich cards instead of plain text URLs.
