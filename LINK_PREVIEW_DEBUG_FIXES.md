# Link Preview Debug Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. PostCardView Disabling Link Previews
**Problem**: In `PostCardView.swift` line 176, link previews were conditionally disabled when posts contained media attachments:
```swift
showLinkPreview: displayPost.attachments.isEmpty  // ‚ùå Disabled for posts with media
```

**Fix**: Changed to always show link previews:
```swift
showLinkPreview: true  // ‚úÖ Always show link previews
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging

Added detailed debugging throughout the link detection pipeline:

#### URLService.swift
- Added debug logging to `extractLinks()` method to track:
  - Text processing steps
  - NSDataDetector results
  - URL validation and filtering
  - Final accepted URLs

#### Post+ContentView.swift
- Added debug logging to `regularLinkPreviewsOnly` to track:
  - Post content analysis
  - Platform-specific processing
  - Link categorization (social media, YouTube, regular)
  - Preview generation

#### HTMLString.swift
- Added debug logging to `extractFirstURL` to track:
  - HTML content processing
  - URL extraction from HTML

#### StabilizedLinkPreview.swift
- Added debug logging to track:
  - Component creation
  - Metadata loading process
  - Success/failure states

## Debug Output Format

The debug logging uses consistent prefixes:
- üîç `[URLService]` - URL detection and validation
- üîó `[regularLinkPreviewsOnly]` - Post content analysis
- üîç `[HTMLString]` - HTML processing
- üéØ `[StabilizedLinkPreview]` - Preview component lifecycle

## Testing

Created `TestPlayground.swift` with:
- Link detection tests for various text formats
- Post content preview tests
- Real-time debugging output

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **All posts should show link previews** regardless of media attachments
2. **Debug console** will show detailed information about:
   - Links found in post content
   - Why certain URLs might be filtered out
   - Preview component creation and loading

## Common Issues to Look For

Based on the debugging, check for:

1. **No links detected**: Check URLService debug output for filtering reasons
2. **Links detected but no previews**: Check StabilizedLinkPreview debug output
3. **HTML content issues**: Check HTMLString debug output for Mastodon posts
4. **Platform-specific issues**: Check regularLinkPreviewsOnly debug output

## Next Steps

1. Run the app and observe console output with `üîç`, `üîó`, and `üéØ` prefixes
2. Test with posts containing different types of links
3. Verify both Bluesky and Mastodon posts work correctly
4. Check network connectivity for link metadata fetching

The debug logging will help identify exactly where in the pipeline link detection or preview generation is failing.
