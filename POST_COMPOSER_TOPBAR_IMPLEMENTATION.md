# Post Composer Top Bar Redesign Implementation

## Overview

The post composer top bar has been completely redesigned to replace the pill-style platform toggles with circular profile pictures representing user accounts. This implementation follows Apple's Liquid Glass design guidelines and provides a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Key Features

### 1. Profile Picture-Based Account Selection
- **Circular Avatars**: Each logged-in account is represented by a circular profile picture
- **Platform Badges**: Each avatar includes a platform logo badge (Mastodon/Bluesky) in the bottom-right corner
- **Multiple Accounts**: Supports multiple accounts per platform, each shown as a separate profile icon

### 2. Interactive States
- **Active State**: Full color, glowing selection ring in platform color, subtle shadow effect
- **Inactive State**: Desaturated (50% opacity, 30% saturation), no glow effect
- **Selection Ring**: 3px border in platform color with subtle shadow for active accounts
- **Smooth Animations**: Eased transitions between states (0.15s duration)

### 3. Liquid Glass Aesthetics
- **Background Material**: Uses `Material.regularMaterial` for the top bar background
- **Visibility Button**: Circular button with `Material.regularMaterial` background and subtle stroke
- **Empty State**: `Material.ultraThinMaterial` for the "Add Account" hint
- **Drop Shadows**: Subtle black shadows with 10% opacity for depth

### 4. Visibility Control
- **Eye Icon**: Top-right corner with dynamic icon based on selected visibility:
  - `eye`: Public posts
  - `eye.slash`: Unlisted posts  
  - `lock`: Followers-only posts
- **Menu Interface**: Picker with icons and text labels for each visibility option

### 5. Account Management
- **Tap Interaction**: Toggle account inclusion in the post
- **Long Press**: Opens account switcher sheet (planned for future implementation)
- **All/Individual Selection**: Supports both "all accounts" and specific account selection modes

## Implementation Details

### Current Status: Inline Implementation
The component is currently implemented inline within `ComposeView.swift` due to Xcode project file constraints. The full standalone component (`PostComposerTopBar.swift`) is available and ready to be integrated when the project file can be updated.

### File Structure
```
SocialFusion/Views/Components/PostComposerTopBar.swift  // Standalone component (ready)
SocialFusion/Views/ComposeView.swift                    // Contains inline implementation
```

### Key Components
1. **ProfileToggleButton**: Handles individual account display and interaction
2. **VisibilityButton**: Manages post visibility selection with appropriate icons
3. **EmptyAccountsView**: Shows helpful hint when no accounts are configured
4. **AccountSwitcherSheet**: Future component for switching between accounts of the same platform

### iOS Compatibility
- **iOS 16+ Compatible**: Removed iOS 17+ specific APIs like `sensoryFeedback`
- **Material Backgrounds**: Uses explicit `Material.regularMaterial` syntax for compatibility
- **Color System**: Uses platform-specific colors from `SocialAccount.platform.color`

### Account Selection Logic
```swift
private func toggleAccountSelection(_ account: SocialAccount) {
    if selectedAccountIds.contains("all") {
        // Switch from "all" to individual selection
        selectedAccountIds = [account.id]
    } else if selectedAccountIds.contains(account.id) {
        selectedAccountIds.remove(account.id)
        // Prevent empty selection - default back to "all"
        if selectedAccountIds.isEmpty {
            selectedAccountIds = ["all"]
        }
    } else {
        selectedAccountIds.insert(account.id)
    }
}
```

## Design Specifications

### Layout
- **Horizontal Scroll**: Profile pictures arranged in horizontal scrollable container
- **Spacing**: 16pt between profile pictures, 12pt spacing in main HStack
- **Padding**: 16pt horizontal padding around scroll content, 12pt vertical padding for entire bar

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Avatar Size**: 44pt diameter (standard iOS touch target)
- **Badge Size**: 18pt platform badge with 2pt offset positioning
- **Selection Ring**: 3pt stroke width, 1.1x scale factor for subtle outer ring effect
- **Glow Effect**: 4pt radius shadow for active accounts, 8pt blur radius for background glow

### Animations
- **Selection Changes**: 0.15s ease-in-out for opacity and saturation changes
- **Visibility Icon**: 0.2s ease-in-out for icon transitions
- **Hover Effects**: Spring animation (0.3s response, 0.6 damping) for press states

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Long Press Support
- Account switcher sheet for platforms with multiple accounts
- Quick account switching without going to settings

### Phase 2: Advanced Interactions
- Drag and drop reordering of accounts
- Contextual menus for account-specific actions

### Phase 3: Visual Polish
- Haptic feedback integration (iOS 17+)
- More sophisticated Liquid Glass effects
- Dynamic Island integration for posting status

## Integration Notes

### For Developers
1. The inline implementation in `ComposeView.swift` is fully functional
2. To use the standalone component, add `PostComposerTopBar.swift` to the Xcode project
3. Replace the inline implementation with the standalone component call
4. Ensure proper iOS 16+ deployment target for Material backgrounds

### Testing Scenarios
1. **No Accounts**: Shows "Add Account" empty state
2. **Single Account**: Direct selection/deselection
3. **Multiple Accounts Same Platform**: Individual toggles work correctly
4. **Multiple Platforms**: Platform-specific styling and behavior
5. **All/Individual Modes**: Proper switching between selection modes

## Accessibility

### VoiceOver Support
- Profile pictures have proper accessibility labels with account names
- Visibility button announces current state and available options
- Platform badges are announced as part of the account description

### Dynamic Type
- All text elements scale with system font size preferences
- Icon sizes maintain proportional scaling
- Touch targets remain accessible at all font sizes

### Reduced Motion
- Animations respect `accessibilityReduceMotion` setting
- Essential state changes remain visible without animation
- Focus management maintained for keyboard navigation

This implementation successfully replaces the old pill-style toggles with a more intuitive, visually appealing, and functionally rich profile-based interface that aligns with modern iOS design principles and Apple's Liquid Glass aesthetic.
