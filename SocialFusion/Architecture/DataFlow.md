# SocialFusion Data Flow Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the data flow and architectural boundaries within the SocialFusion application.

## Data Flow Map

### Core Components
1. **Post Model**
   - Source of truth for post data
   - Normalized representation of posts from different platforms
   - Handles platform-specific data conversion
   - Supports feature-flagged enhancements

2. **UnifiedPostStore**
   - Central storage for posts
   - Manages post lifecycle
   - Handles post updates and synchronization
   - Implements caching and performance optimizations

3. **TimelineViewModel**
   - Coordinates between UI and data layer
   - Manages post fetching and display logic
   - Handles user interactions
   - Supports both legacy and new architecture

### Service Layer
1. **SocialServiceManager**
   - Coordinates between different social platforms
   - Manages authentication and API calls
   - Handles platform-specific operations
   - Implements feature-flagged enhancements

2. **Platform Services**
   - BlueskyService
   - MastodonService
   - Each handles platform-specific API interactions
   - Supports gradual migration to new architecture

### View Layer
1. **PostCardView**
   - Displays individual posts
   - Handles user interactions
   - Manages post content rendering
   - Supports feature-flagged UI enhancements

2. **UnifiedTimelineView**
   - Displays combined timeline
   - Manages post list
   - Handles scrolling and pagination
   - Implements performance optimizations

### Utility Layer
1. **FeatureFlagManager**
   - Manages feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Tracks feature usage and enablement
   - Provides analytics for feature adoption
   - Supports emergency rollback

2. **MonitoringService**
   - Tracks app performance metrics
   - Monitors error rates
   - Measures response times
   - Tracks memory and CPU usage

## Architectural Boundaries

### Data Layer
- Models should be platform-agnostic
- Data conversion happens at service boundaries
- Post normalization is handled by PostNormalizer
- Feature flags control data structure enhancements

### Service Layer
- Platform-specific code is isolated
- Common interfaces for cross-platform operations
- Error handling and retry logic
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### View Layer
- Views are data-source agnostic
- UI components are reusable
- State management through ViewModels
- Feature flags control UI enhancements

## Dependencies
- View Layer → ViewModel Layer
- ViewModel Layer → Service Layer
- Service Layer → Model Layer
- All Layers → FeatureFlagManager
- All Layers → MonitoringService

## Feature Flags
- useNewArchitecture: Controls overall architecture migration
- useNewPostCard: Controls new post card UI
- useNewViewModel: Controls new view model implementation
- useNewBlueskyService: Controls new Bluesky service
- useNewSocialServiceManager: Controls new service manager
- debugMode: Enables debug features
- verboseLogging: Enables detailed logging
- performanceTracking: Enables performance monitoring

## Performance Monitoring
- Error Rate: Tracks errors per minute
- Response Time: Measures API call durations
- Memory Usage: Monitors app memory consumption
- CPU Usage: Tracks processor utilization

## Migration Strategy
1. Feature flags control gradual rollout
2. Both old and new implementations run in parallel
3. Performance metrics guide migration decisions
4. Emergency rollback available if needed
