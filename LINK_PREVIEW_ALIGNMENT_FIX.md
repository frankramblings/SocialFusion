# Link Preview Alignment Fix

## Issue
The link previews in SocialFusion had poor alignment compared to the clean, professional appearance in Ivory app. The previews appeared disconnected from the post content with inconsistent spacing and layout structure.

## Problems Identified

### Layout Issues
1. **Complex vertical layout**: Original design used a complex VStack with image-on-top approach
2. **Inconsistent padding**: Multiple padding values (12px, 16px) created misalignment
3. **Poor text hierarchy**: Fonts and spacing didn't match modern design standards
4. **Disconnected appearance**: Preview cards felt separate from post content flow

### Spacing Problems
1. **Tight spacing**: Only 4px between post content and link preview
2. **Internal inconsistencies**: Different spacing within the preview components
3. **Image sizing**: Variable image sizes that didn't align properly

## Solution: Ivory-Style Layout

### 1. Switched to Horizontal Layout (HStack)
**Before:** Vertical image-above-text layout
```swift
VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 0) {
    // Image on top
    // Text below
}
```

**After:** Clean horizontal layout matching Ivory
```swift
HStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 12) {
    // Left-aligned image (72x72)
    // Right-aligned text content
}
```

### 2. Consistent Sizing and Spacing
- **Image size**: Fixed 72x72px (consistent with Ivory's compact design)
- **Internal spacing**: Uniform 12px between image and text
- **External spacing**: Increased to 8px between post content and preview
- **Padding**: Standardized 16px internal padding

### 3. Improved Typography
- **Title**: Changed from `.callout` to `.subheadline` with medium weight
- **Description**: Added proper description extraction with 2-line limit
- **Host**: Consistent `.caption` styling with proper alignment
- **Alignment**: All text properly left-aligned within the content area

### 4. Better Visual Integration
- **Background**: Consistent system colors for light/dark mode
- **Borders**: Clean separator-colored strokes
- **Corner radius**: Standardized 12px rounded corners
- **Color scheme**: Proper contrast for all content

## Key Improvements

### Before vs After Comparison

| Aspect | Before (Broken) | After (Ivory-style) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (VStack) | Horizontal (HStack) |
| Image Size | Variable (80x80, 70% height) | Fixed (72x72) |
| Spacing | 4px top padding | 8px top padding |
| Typography | .callout title | .subheadline title |
| Alignment | Inconsistent | Left-aligned throughout |
| Padding | 12px internal | 16px internal |

   - Complete layout restructure from VStack to HStack
