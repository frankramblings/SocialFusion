# Real API Migration Summary

## Issue
The SocialFusion app was incorrectly using sample data instead of connecting to real Mastodon and Bluesky APIs when there were authentication or connection issues.

## Root Cause
The app had multiple fallback mechanisms that would load sample posts (`Post.samplePosts`) instead of showing proper empty states or error handling when API calls failed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Sample Data Fallbacks in UnifiedTimelineView

**File:** `SocialFusion/SocialFusion/Views/UnifiedTimelineView.swift`

- **Line ~100:** Removed `serviceManager.loadSamplePosts()` call when no accounts are available
- **Line ~248:** Removed `serviceManager.loadSamplePosts()` call in refresh error handling  
- **Line ~345:** Replaced `serviceManager.loadSamplePosts()` with proper API call `try await serviceManager.refreshTimeline(force: false)`

### 2. Removed Sample Data Fallbacks in SocialServiceManager

**File:** `SocialFusion/Services/SocialServiceManager.swift`

- **Line ~613:** Removed fallback to `Post.samplePosts` when API calls return empty results
- **Line ~806:** Removed fallback to `Post.samplePosts` when API calls fail with errors

### 3. Removed Sample Data Fallbacks in AccountTimelineView

**File:** `SocialFusion/Views/AccountTimelineView.swift`

- **Line ~82:** Removed fallback to filtered `Post.samplePosts` when individual account timeline fails

## Result

The app now:

1. **Connects to Real APIs:** When accounts are configured, the app makes actual API calls to Mastodon and Bluesky services
2. **Shows Proper Empty States:** When no accounts are configured or API calls fail, the app shows appropriate empty state UI instead of misleading sample data
3. **Handles Errors Correctly:** API failures are properly surfaced to the user instead of being masked by sample data
4. **Builds Successfully:** All changes maintain compilation compatibility

## Verification

The app has been tested to build successfully with these changes. When run:

- **With accounts configured:** App will make real API calls to fetch timeline data
- **Without accounts:** App will show "Welcome to SocialFusion" empty state with "Add Account" button
- **With API failures:** App will show error messages and empty timeline instead of sample data

## API Service Status

The following services are confirmed to make real API calls:

- **MastodonService:** Makes actual calls to Mastodon instances (e.g., mastodon.social)
- **BlueskyService:** Makes actual calls to Bluesky/AT Protocol endpoints (e.g., bsky.social)

Both services include proper authentication, pagination, and error handling for real-world usage.

## Next Steps

1. Add real social media accounts using the AccountsView interface
2. The app will then fetch real posts from your connected accounts
3. All interactions (like, repost, reply) will affect real posts on the actual platforms

## Important Note

The sample data in `Post.samplePosts` is still available for SwiftUI previews and development testing, but it is no longer used in the actual runtime application flow.
