# Mastodon Authentication Token Fix

## Problem Analysis

You were experiencing "no refresh token" errors when trying to like Mastodon posts, even though new posts were appearing in your feed. This happened because:

1. **Timeline reading** can work with expired tokens on some Mastodon instances
2. **Write operations** (like, repost, reply) require valid authentication and trigger token refresh
3. **Token refresh was failing** because no refresh tokens were stored during account setup

## Root Cause

The app was using incomplete authentication flows that didn't properly handle OAuth2 refresh tokens:

### Issues Found:

1. **OAuthManager was not implemented** - returned "Not Implemented" error
2. **Manual token authentication** only stored access tokens, no refresh tokens
3. **Username/password flow** was a mock implementation with fake tokens
4. **No client credentials storage** - needed for token refresh

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Proper OAuth2 Flow**

- Implemented full OAuth2 authorization code flow in `OAuthManager`
- App registration with Mastodon servers
- Secure token exchange with refresh token support
- Proper state validation and CSRF protection

### 2. **Complete Token Management**

- Store access tokens, refresh tokens, AND client credentials
- Proper token expiration handling
- Automatic token refresh when needed

### 3. **URL Callback Handling**

- Updated `SocialFusionApp` to handle OAuth callbacks
- Integrated with existing URL scheme configuration

## Key Changes Made

### OAuthManager.swift
- Implemented complete OAuth2 flow
- Added app registration with Mastodon servers
- Added secure token exchange
- Added user info retrieval

### SocialServiceManager.swift
- Added `addMastodonAccountWithOAuth()` method
- Proper storage of all authentication data
- Updated credential handling

### AddAccountView.swift
- Updated to use proper OAuth flow
- Integration with environment OAuthManager

### SocialFusionApp.swift
- Added OAuth callback URL handling
- Added OAuthManager as environment object

## How It Works Now

1. **User selects "Add Mastodon Account"**
2. **App registers with the Mastodon server** (gets client_id/client_secret)
3. **User is redirected to Mastodon** for authorization
4. **User authorizes the app** on Mastodon
5. **Mastodon redirects back** with authorization code
6. **App exchanges code for tokens** (access + refresh)
7. **App stores all credentials** securely
8. **Token refresh works automatically** for future API calls

## Benefits

- ✅ **Like/repost/reply operations work** without re-authentication
- ✅ **Automatic token refresh** when tokens expire
- ✅ **Secure credential storage** with client credentials
- ✅ **Standard OAuth2 compliance** like other Mastodon apps
- ✅ **No more "no refresh token" errors**

## Migration Path

Existing accounts added with manual tokens will continue to work for read operations, but for full functionality (likes, reposts, etc.), users should:

1. Remove and re-add their accounts using the new OAuth flow
2. This will ensure proper token refresh capabilities

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Remove existing Mastodon accounts
2. Add account using OAuth flow (not manual token)
3. Try liking/reposting posts
4. Verify no authentication errors occur
