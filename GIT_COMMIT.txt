feat: Implement no-reflow media layout system for stable feed scrolling

Implements a comprehensive stable media layout contract that prevents
jerky scrolling and layout reflow in the feed. Feed rows maintain stable
heights after first appearance, preventing jumps when images load,
banners appear/disappear, or content updates.

Core Components:
- PostLayoutSnapshot: Value type capturing all layout-affecting properties
- PostLayoutSnapshotBuilder: Builds stable snapshots from Post objects
- MediaDimensionCache: Memory + disk cache with TTL and LRU eviction
- ImageSizeFetcher: Async dimension fetching via HTTP Range requests
- MediaPrefetcher: Prefetches dimensions for upcoming posts
- MediaContainerView: SwiftUI container with fixed aspect ratio
- FeedUpdateCoordinator: Batches updates with anchor preservation

Integration:
- ConsolidatedTimelineView: Builds snapshots and prefetches dimensions
- PostCardView: Uses stable media container when snapshot provided

Key Features:
✅ Stable row heights after first appearance
✅ Media uses fixed aspect ratios (no layout changes on image load)
✅ Banner stability with fixed heights
✅ Anchor preservation for layout-affecting updates
✅ Aggressive prefetching to minimize missing dimensions
✅ Backward compatible (graceful fallback if no snapshot)

- SocialFusion/Views/ConsolidatedTimelineView.swift

Testing:
- Unit tests for PostLayoutSnapshotBuilder
- Test cases for posts with/without media, boosts, replies
- Snapshot stability verification

Performance:
- Dimension fetching uses Range requests (minimal data transfer)
- Aggressive caching reduces redundant fetches
- Prefetching happens before posts appear
- Batch updates prevent excessive view updates

Compatibility: iOS 16+, forward compatible with iOS 17+, no deprecated APIs
