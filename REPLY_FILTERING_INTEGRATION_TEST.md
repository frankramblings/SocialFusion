# Reply Filtering Integration Test

## Overview
This document outlines how to manually test the reply filtering implementation that was just completed.

## Implementation Complete ✅

The following components have been successfully implemented:

### Core Architecture
1. **UserID Model** (`SocialFusion/Models/SocialModels.swift`)
   - Cross-platform user identification
   - Support for both Mastodon and Bluesky formats

2. **ThreadParticipantResolver Protocol** (`SocialFusion/Models/SocialModels.swift`)
   - Abstract interface for resolving thread participants
   - Platform-agnostic design

3. **Platform-Specific Resolvers**
   - `MastodonThreadResolver` - Uses Mastodon context API
   - `BlueskyThreadResolver` - Uses Bluesky getPostThread API

4. **PostFeedFilter** (`SocialFusion/Models/SocialModels.swift`)
   - Main filtering coordinator with caching
   - Feature flag support for debugging

### API Integration
1. **Following APIs Added**
   - `MastodonService.fetchFollowing()` - Gets user's following list
   - `BlueskyService.fetchFollowing()` - Gets user's following list

2. **Timeline Integration**
   - `SocialServiceManager.filterRepliesInTimeline()` - Applies filtering
   - `SocialServiceManager.getFollowedAccounts()` - Fetches all following lists

### Debugging Support
1. **Debug View** (`SocialFusion/Views/DebugOptionsView.swift`)
   - Toggle to enable/disable reply filtering
   - Real-time control for testing

## Manual Testing Steps

### Prerequisites
1. Have both Mastodon and Bluesky accounts configured in the app
2. Ensure the accounts have some following relationships

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Basic Reply Filtering
1. Open the app and go to the Debug Options
2. Ensure "Enable Reply Filtering" is ON
3. View the timeline - replies should only appear if they meet the criteria

#### 2. Feature Flag Testing
1. Go to Debug Options 
2. Toggle "Enable Reply Filtering" OFF
3. Verify that ALL replies now appear in the timeline
4. Toggle it back ON
5. Verify filtering resumes

#### 3. Cross-Platform Testing
1. Find a Mastodon thread with multiple participants
2. Verify only threads with 2+ followed users show replies
3. Find a Bluesky thread with multiple participants  
4. Verify the same filtering logic applies

## Expected Behavior

### Always Shown:
- Top-level posts from any user
- Self-replies from followed users
- Replies from followed users (self-threads)

### Conditionally Shown:
- Replies are shown ONLY IF the thread contains ≥2 followed accounts
- This applies to both Mastodon and Bluesky

### Performance Features:
- Thread participant resolution is cached (5 minutes)
- Following lists are fetched concurrently for all accounts
- Error handling defaults to showing posts (fail-open)

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

The implementation builds successfully with Swift:
```bash
swift build  # ✅ Exit code: 0
```

## Next Steps

To verify end-to-end functionality:

1. **Add Test Accounts**: Set up accounts that follow each other
2. **Create Test Threads**: Have conversations between followed/unfollowed users
3. **Verify Filtering**: Check that replies only appear when thread has ≥2 followed participants
4. **Test Performance**: Observe caching behavior in debug console

## Technical Notes

- The implementation is backward compatible and doesn't break existing functionality
- All following API calls are made asynchronously and in parallel
- Caching prevents redundant API calls for the same thread
- The feature can be completely disabled via debug toggle
- Error handling ensures the timeline remains functional even if thread resolution fails

The core reply filtering logic from the original MCP specification has been successfully implemented and integrated with the existing SocialFusion codebase.
