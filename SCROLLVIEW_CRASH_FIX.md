# ScrollViewProxy Crash Fix

## üö® Problem
The app was crashing with a fatal SwiftUI error:
```
SwiftUI/ScrollViewReader.swift:105: Fatal error: ScrollViewProxy may not be accessed during view updates
```

This error occurs when trying to use a ScrollViewReader's proxy to call `scrollTo()` while SwiftUI is in the middle of updating views.

## üîç Root Cause
The crash was happening in the smart restoration feature in `UnifiedTimelineView.swift`. The code was trying to restore scroll position by calling `proxy.scrollTo()` in an `.onAppear` modifier, which can execute during SwiftUI's view update cycle.

## ‚úÖ Solution

### 1. Replaced `.onAppear` with `.task`
- Changed from `.onAppear { Task { ... } }` to `.task { ... }`
- `.task` is safer for async operations and runs after view setup is complete
- Added longer delay (0.5 seconds instead of 0.3) to ensure view is fully initialized

### 2. Added Safety Guards
- Check that `displayEntries` is not empty before attempting restoration
- Check that `hasInitiallyLoaded` is true to ensure data is ready
- Added bounds checking before scroll operations

### 3. Used DispatchQueue for ScrollViewProxy Access
- Wrapped all `proxy.scrollTo()` calls in `DispatchQueue.main.async`
- This ensures the scroll operation happens in the next run loop cycle
- Prevents access during view updates

### 4. Fixed State Update Timing
- Wrapped `.onReceive(viewModel.$state)` logic in `Task { @MainActor in ... }`
- This prevents potential AttributeGraph cycles during state updates

## üéØ Code Changes

### Before (Problematic):
```swift
.onAppear {
    Task {
        try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 300_000_000)
        let restoration = timelineState.restorePositionIntelligently()
        
        if let index = restoration.index, index < displayEntries.count {
            let targetEntry = displayEntries[index]
            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.8)) {
                proxy.scrollTo(targetEntry.id, anchor: .top) // ‚ùå Fatal error here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```swift
.task {
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 500_000_000)
    
    guard !displayEntries.isEmpty, hasInitiallyLoaded else {
        print("üéØ Smart restoration skipped - view not ready")
        return
    }
    
    let restoration = timelineState.restorePositionIntelligently()
    
    if let index = restoration.index, index < displayEntries.count, index >= 0 {
        let targetEntry = displayEntries[index]
        
        await MainActor.run {
            DispatchQueue.main.async { // ‚úÖ Safe access
                guard index < displayEntries.count else {
                    print("üéØ Smart restoration cancelled - index out of bounds")
                    return
                }
                
                withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.8)) {
                    proxy.scrollTo(targetEntry.id, anchor: .top) // ‚úÖ Now safe
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Safeguards
- All scroll operations now have bounds checking
- State updates are properly isolated with `Task { @MainActor in ... }`
- AttributeGraph cycle warnings should be reduced
- Scroll restoration only happens when view is properly initialized

## üì± Impact
- ‚úÖ App no longer crashes when restoring scroll position
- ‚úÖ Smart restoration still works but is now safe
- ‚úÖ Scroll to top functionality is protected from timing issues
- ‚úÖ Reduced AttributeGraph cycle warnings
- ‚úÖ Better iOS 16+ compatibility

## üîß CloudKit Setup
The CloudKit entitlements have also been properly configured:
- Created `SocialFusion.entitlements` with CloudKit permissions
- Added development environment for push notifications
- Set up proper container identifier: `iCloud.socialfusion`
